## Soundcool
Port of Soundcool to Web Audio API

### Running SoundCool is a 2 step-process.

- ##### STEP 1 : Installing NodeJS
	- npm is distributed with Node.js- which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer using the link [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
	- Check the version of nodejs and npm by running the following on your terminal.
		- `node -v`
		- `npm -v`

- ##### STEP 2 : Running it locally.
	- Open the root directory of soundcool on your terminal i.e /soundcool. It can be cloned [here](https://github.com/rbdannenberg/soundcool).
	- Run ` npm install`. It might take a minute or more depending on your internet connection.
	- Run `npm start`. It will take about half a minute to instantiate.
